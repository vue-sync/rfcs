# Vuex Cloud
Vuex Cloud provides a set of tools to keep your Vuex store seemlessly in sync with a remote backend.  
Currently supports Google Firebase's Firestore.

# @vuex-cloud/vuex-setters
A set of actions which let you easily update the data of your store.  
You will no longer have to write your own mutations.  
Under the hood, the library emits a series of events that other projects may bind on to provide a wide range of new features.  
Can be used standalone, without other Vuex Cloud tools.

# @vuex-cloud/vuex-cloud-firestore
Automatic sync of your Vuex store store with Google Firebase's Firestore, with various options.
